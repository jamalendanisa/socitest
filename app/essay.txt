2. How​ ​do​ ​you​ ​add​ ​validation​ ​and​ ​error​ ​messages​ ​to​ ​the​ ​form? 
   I usually use AngularJS for the framework so i use form validation by binding the form with the model state.
   If the model is required and it's still empty when the user click the submit button, it will have the error value.
   Then, the error messages​ can be shown.

4. What​ ​is​ ​the​ ​difference​ ​between​ ​responsive​ ​and​ ​adaptive​ ​design? 
   Responsive design is one layout design that works no matter what the screen size is. No matter how much 
   the screen's resized, that same layout will automatically respond to that size.
   While Adaptive design is several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. 
   And the layout used depends on the screen size used. There could be a specific layout for mobile phones,
   tablets, and desktop computers, each of which are made in advance. These three designs wait on standby
   until someone visits the site. The site detects the type of device used,and delivers the pre-set layout for that device.
